### Project Overview

 Problem statement:-
You are a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as you can. But before that you wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that you can budget it from your revenue. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. I build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.


### Learnings from the project
