### Project Overview

 Problem Statement:
                    The problem statement revolves around the need to predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data).

It includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. I have predicted an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:

1 - Spruce/Fir 2 - Lodgepole Pine 3 - Ponderosa Pine 4 - Cottonwood/Willow 5 - Aspen 6 - Douglas-fir 7 - Krummholz
